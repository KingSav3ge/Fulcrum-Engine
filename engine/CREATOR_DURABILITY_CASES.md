# Proposed Creator host characterization cases

Status: **review cases, not executable tests or passed evidence**. Engine review
branch based on `ecca8094a2d2cdb8a11e018a085487288b26e88d`. These cases
characterize the proposed [host contract](DRAFT_HOST_ATOMIC_CONTRACT.md) for
the App owner and coordinator to turn into real authenticated host tests.
Do not enable durable Creator creation until the contract is agreed and these
cases pass on the actual selected host. Use synthetic stores, private markers
and explicitly selected drafts; never open user saves or make provider calls.

## Known source characterization, not a Creator result

At App `c04ba5524ae95316c7e826fc63085a4916d7dd67`,
`IRGS_Web/server.py::Store.write` flushes and fsyncs a temporary file, replaces
the campaign path, then calls `sync_parent`. A parent-sync exception can follow
visibility of the complete replacement. `Store.action_result` retries the
directory sync for certain existing gameplay requests before returning a saved
result. `IRGS_Web/assistance.py::SoloService.rotate_restore` changes a private
guard in separate metadata before restore. The existing
`test_intent_bridge.IntentBridgeTests.test_failed_save_restart_and_uncertain_sync_recover_original_once`
covers a gameplay request, not Creator creation or crash durability. App's
`sync_parent` is a no-op on Windows; do not infer Windows durability from POSIX.

## Cases to implement and execute at the actual host boundary

Each case uses the real authenticated Creator guard and normal draft initializer
for both selected profiles where applicable. Record exact Engine/App/Catalog
commits, commands, OS/filesystem and injected point. Observe both public
responses and trusted host state; raw state must never become browser output.

1. **Review and cancel:** Preview both bounded drafts. Capture campaign listing,
   save bytes and creation index before/after validation, cancellation and
   unaccepted creation. Assert no world, request receipt or membership is
   published; preview identities cannot authorize a subsequent action.
2. **Pre-publication failure:** Fail temporary write, file flush, file fsync and
   replace separately. Where the host can prove replace never happened, expect
   definite rejection and no visible campaign, owner record or result. Reusing
   the same authorized request after recovery must follow the host's documented
   reservation/retention rules.
3. **Visible but unconfirmed:** Cause parent-directory sync to fail immediately
   after the successful atomic replacement. Assert that the complete envelope
   may be present but no success is acknowledged; status is
   `confirmation_pending`, with only the original request ID and no private
   scope or actor view. An exact authorized retry must not reinitialize or write
   another campaign. Make sync succeed; then obtain the stored original receipt
   exactly once. Assert actor-filtered view and unchanged physical effects.
4. **Repeated uncertainty and unauthorized callers:** Keep directory sync
   failing over status/retry and assert the result remains pending; altered
   bound payload conflicts without mutation. Deny another principal and forged
   campaign/handle without disclosing whether the request exists.
5. **Restart on each side of publication:** Interrupt before replace, after
   replace but before directory sync, and after confirmed sync before the
   response. Restart the real host. The last case returns the identical original
   receipt. In the middle case, test both surviving and lost directory entries.
   If a surviving envelope matches, revalidate and confirm it without
   reinitialization; if it vanished and no separately durable request evidence
   proves a safe disposition, fail closed rather than guessing rollback or
   silently creating again. Simulate loss with isolated filesystem fixtures;
   distinguish injected faults from real filesystem crash qualification.
6. **Concurrency and collision:** Send identical requests from separate host
   processes, then same request ID with changed draft/owner/campaign and two
   distinct requests for the same campaign identity. Assert one coherent tuple,
   one initializer/effect at most, exact original result for identical retries,
   safe conflicts for the others and no cross-owner disclosure. In-process
   threading alone does not establish multi-process serialization.
7. **Historical versus live scope:** Place distinctive synthetic markers in
   the internal branch, restore guard, state digest, unrelated actor and raw
   draft. Assert none occurs anywhere in public pending/confirmed responses,
   including nested projections. The optional public history handle is random,
   separately stored and non-authorizing; omitting it is valid. An attempt to
   submit it as current authority fails.
8. **Restore and discarded future:** Create and play, preserve the original
   receipt, prepare a later action, restore earlier state with a fresh private
   guard, then attempt that action and old current-view guards. They must fail.
   An authorized original creation retry returns the same original historical
   receipt without recreating state or disclosing the new guard; fresh actor view
   and commands require current authentication and scope. Inject failures around
   both campaign and guard persistence; never expose a mixed restored state.
9. **Trash, deletion and evidence retention:** Exercise authorized trash,
   restore, retained tombstone and eventual retention expiry. A creation retry
   must not resurrect a trashed/deleted campaign or reveal another owner's
   information. Missing or inconsistent request/receipt/ownership evidence is
   recovery-required until the host proves a safe disposition; no automatic
   replacement is allowed.
10. **Later play and full replay:** After confirmed creation, commit a supported
    action, reload/restart and replay the original creation request. Assert the
    original initial actor view, not the newer world view, and no second effects,
    stock transfer, elapsed work, initializer or provider request. Confirm the
    two drafts create independent worlds and preserve unknown historical time.

Negative tests must verify no newly granted stock, authority, consent or civil
hour; success means a supported exact result, not broader Alpha qualification.
The coordinator and App owner must explicitly settle DTO names, visibility,
transport/status codes, retention and crash-recovery implementation. This file
does not assert their agreement or implement any route.
