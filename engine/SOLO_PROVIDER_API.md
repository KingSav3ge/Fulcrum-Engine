# Solo proposal API, version 1

Delivery target: **IRGS 3.4.0 — in development**. Core compatibility remains 3.3;
the proposal schema's independent version remains `solo-proposal-1`.

`solo_provider.py` and `solo_actions.py` implement the first bounded Capability
Broker beside Core 3.3. Dispatch and every route default to disabled. The only
task is `propose_local_action`, assigned to the existing Local Director category.
It supports the existing authored-scene and bounded Rise settlement operations.
No Director, K-owner, resource ledger or world authority is added.

## Host integration

Import from `IRGS_3_3/runtime`, as with the existing Core modules. Authenticate
the host session and actor before invoking these **server-only** functions.
Never deserialize an ActorRequest supplied by a browser or provider into an
authorized request. The host builds it from its selected CoreWorld:

```python
request = prepare_request(
    world, request_id=submission_id, actor_id=authenticated_actor,
    intention=exact_player_text, branch_id=current_branch,
    restore_id=current_restore_identity, allowed_routes=(approved_route_id,),
    classification=reviewed_classification, policy_ref=reviewed_transfer_policy,
    config_version=selected_config_version, deadline=time.time() + 30)
result = broker.dispatch(request, approved_route_id, transport)
```

Construct `AttemptLedger(private_runtime_dir / 'inference.sqlite',
budget_units=explicit_finite_ceiling, max_inflight=explicit_limit)` outside source,
then `CapabilityBroker(SpecialistRegistry(routes), ledger, enabled=True,
scope_reader=host_current_authorized_scope)` only
after explicit operator configuration. The API does not choose a budget, rate,
credential, workload permission or host policy for the operator.

The immutable request binds campaign, branch, restore identity, whole-state
digest, actor, exact intention, received information, allowed operation/actions/routes,
classification/policy, prompt/schema/config versions, deadline and output limits.
New dispatch has a maximum 300-second horizon. Request/output/context sizes are
bounded. A route needs explicit qualification, tested schema capability, workload,
classification, policy/config agreement, versioned price/ceiling and approval.
`Route.operations` defaults to `execute_player_scene_action`; explicitly include
`execute_settlement_action` to allow Rise. The operation is fixed by the trusted
world binding and request, never chosen by provider output. Older local requests
retain their original implicit-operation fingerprints and receipt identity.
Missing values stay unavailable. There are no automatic retries or fallbacks.
The required `scope_reader(request)` returns the host's currently authorized
`WorldScope`, or `None` for a closed/inaccessible session. It is checked before
dispatch, after transport and before returning a cached proposal. Stale replies
therefore remain unavailable before presentation as well as before acceptance.

`transport(model_input, route, timeout=..., max_output_tokens=...)` returns a
`TransportReply`. Only `request.model_input()` enters transport: actor ID, exact
intention, received evidence (with status/provenance/receipt time), received
options and allowed action/source IDs. Private world/restore hashes, full saves,
rules, unreceived evidence, hidden stock/blockers and evaluator oracles are absent.
Source records are data, never instructions or transfer authorization. The host
must review rights and policy for the complete scoped input before dispatch.
The builder retains the latest 32 received records by receipt time and ID and
discloses the total/limit in `context.received_window`. Earlier records stay in
Core; no model summary replaces them. This keeps continued requests bounded as
history grows. It does not promise that every past fact is in each prompt.
Rise uses published conditional action descriptions and only this actor's
settlement receipts; private stocks/projects are never scanned for a winning menu.

## Draft, acceptance and persistence

The sole proposal schema is:

```json
{"intention":"exact original text","action_id":"received-action-id","source_refs":["received-evidence-id"]}
```

Additional/duplicate keys, changed intent, unknown sources/actions, unexpected
route identity, excessive output or provider error produce an unavailable result.
`ValidatedResult.status` is `proposal_ready` or `unavailable`; the latter has a
bounded `code`. Validation establishes structure and references, **not semantic
agreement between prose and action**. Show the exact intention, selected action
and source references together for player review. Draft selection changes no
campaign state. Unsupported freeform/combat stays `declared_not_resolved` in the
existing declaration flow; this API cannot resolve it.

On explicit player acceptance, call:

```python
public_result = accept_proposal(
    current_world, ledger, request_id=result.request_id,
    proposal_digest=result.proposal.proposal_digest,
    actor_id=authenticated_actor, intention=exact_accepted_text,
    branch_id=current_branch, restore_id=current_restore_identity,
    explicitly_accepted=True, persist=host_atomic_compare_and_save, clock=time.time)
```

The callback `persist(expected_scope, candidate_save, public_receipt)` **must**
serialize against every host writer and atomically compare campaign, branch,
restore identity and state digest, then durably save candidate and receipt, or
raise. Reuse the host's existing save transaction; do not create another world
store. A missing callback is unavailable. Candidate execution uses the actual
`execute_scene_action` or `settlement_runtime.execute` handler and its
execution-derived dependency certificate.
Current control, rules, location, commitments and resources retain that handler's
checks. Failed physical attempts retain its supported unsuccessful outcome and
authored elapsed time; they never become a fabricated successful transfer.

The Core event retains the exact accepted intention and structured action.
Result narration is exclusively the committed handler's actor-legitimate summary
and observations. Private dependency certificates stay in the technical ledger.
No generated dialogue, new player decisions or arbitrary event API is exposed.
Rise results use the same `status/outcome/receipt` envelope, with the primary
committed receipt as `outcome.summary`, local inspection as `observations` and
the receipt's `elapsed_total`. They omit a per-action duration if the existing
receipt does not establish it. Project completion remains separate from the
completion of a request to advance qualified work.

**Host obligations:** rotate restore identity whenever restoring a save, including
identical bytes; keep branch identity stable and explicit; invalidate/close old
requests on navigation or session closure using `ledger.cancel(request_id)`;
reload the durable save after an ambiguous persistence acknowledgment. Old
scope/state/control fails before new effects. A committed event returns its
original receipt without effects, including a lost acknowledgment. Competing
acceptors serialize via the shared technical database plus the mandatory host
save CAS. This is not qualification of another host's persistence implementation.

## Accounting and recovery

An attempt and its full conservative reservation are committed before transport.
The ledger stores request identity/versions, requested and reported route,
provider request/response IDs, route/config/adapter/price metadata,
start/completion times, validation result, known token reports
and a private acceptance certificate. No credentials or provider error bodies are
stored. Null/empty usage means **unknown**, never zero cost. Reported tokens are
not a verified bill; actual charges remain unknown. Reservation units are an
operator-defined worst-case ceiling for the approved input/output limits and
versioned prices, separate from campaign money/resources.

Reservations remain consumed for this ledger's lifetime, including failures,
timeouts and cancellations. No automatic refund/reconciliation exists. Concurrent
claims atomically check budget and in-flight limits. A timed-out/cancelled worker
retains its concurrency slot until it actually finishes; a late completion may
record accounting but cannot publish a proposal. A crash with an ambiguous attempt
retains its reservation/slot and returns `in_progress_or_in_doubt` on restart.
There is no automatic redispatch, billing guess or silent budget reset. An operator
must reconcile uncertainty before deliberately provisioning a new budget/attempt.
Use a fresh explicit request ID for a new authorized attempt; never auto-generate
one as a retry. Reopening with different budget limits is rejected.

The database retains exact submitted text and received context for durable
validation. Protect it like the host's private campaign storage; never include it
in source, diagnostics exports, model context for another actor, or browser status.

## Executed scope and remaining gates

`test_solo_provider.py` uses temporary synthetic saves and offline transport.
It exercises actual local movement, observation, blocked movement and conserved
delivery, two successive actions, reload/replay, lost acknowledgment, concurrent
acceptance, host CAS failure, stale state/restore, revoked control, conflicting
commitments, depleted stock, malformed/unsupported output, denial, timeout,
cancellation, late reply, disabled/missing policy, fallback denial and finite budget.
It does not certify general simultaneous-frontier allocation or interrupted phases.

`test_solo_rise.py` additionally checks real settlement movement/founding/work,
reservations, conservation, reload/replay, atomic denial and bounded received
history. `tools/qualify_solo_provider.py --catalog-root /path/to/IRGS_Catalog`
qualifies the exact pinned Catalog R00 export/loader against this boundary. See
[Catalog execution](SOLO_CATALOG_VALIDATION.json) for ten cases, five real commits,
3,900 elapsed seconds and actor/oracle separation. Fixture actor exports enter
only the offline harness; they never initialize or overwrite world facts.

The [opt-in direct adapter](OPENAI_ADAPTER_REVIEW.md) is implemented and tested
with synthetic HTTP. DEV-06–DEV-11 remain open beyond the named observed
handlers, bounded action/work receipts and host-assisted recovery contract.
App session/save integration, exact joined pair, semantic/character human review,
calibration, accounting reconciliation and model quality remain separate.
Conditional live smoke is pending; no paid call is authorized or claimed.
