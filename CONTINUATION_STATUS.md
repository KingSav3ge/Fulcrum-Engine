# Current Engine continuation

## Current increment — 2026-10-22

Publication destination: **KingSav3ge/IRGS-Engine**, on this repository's `main` branch. [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) is the current completed/in-progress/remaining summary; [DEVELOPMENT_LIST.md](DEVELOPMENT_LIST.md) retains task IDs and completion criteria.

**Completed:** added the [Engine model](engine/ENGINE_MODEL.md), clarified behavior-based design language, refined archive introduction wording while retaining original source attribution, and aligned active development instructions with the standalone Engine repository. Gameplay rules and the scope of supported operations are unchanged.

**In progress:** DEV-06–DEV-08 have bounded collection and rejected-path coverage; broader dependency and cross-engine qualification remain open. Authored local scenes, settlement work and historical initialization remain partial foundations for later milestones.

**Next:** choose named DEV-06–DEV-08 gaps from [the operation register](engine/OPERATION_COVERAGE.md). General C2 resolution, durable phases, wider movement/dialogue and sustained institutional autonomy remain on the plan.

**Verification:** the Engine runtime baseline ran 497 tests successfully with one historical private-save fixture skipped. All six archive-provider tests passed after the wording change, and Engine component integrity verified. This increment includes no fresh App/HTTP qualification and does not complete any additional C2 acceptance case.

## Kira atlas reference delivery — 2026-10-22

Added six [illustrated regional atlas plates](IRGS_3_3/catalog/campaigns/kira/atlas/README.md), their creator statements and regional foundations beside the existing Kira worldbook. The notes record the Lupine desert and raids, Aldain’s five lizard-folk homelands and monkey-folk republic, open cultural design for Azaloth and Bendara, and Falkion’s selected fortified-island and maritime direction. Atlas views establish no shared distance scale, executable travel rules or starting snapshots. The PNGs are preserved byte for byte; archive and component verification qualify source integrity, not pixel-perfect survey accuracy or new gameplay behavior.

The Engine development milestones above retain their existing status. App dependency updates and joined IRGS integration are separate from this Engine reference publication.

Verification: all six PNGs match the delivered artwork byte for byte; atlas manifest checksums, the reintroduced Lupine sheet and relative README links pass. The existing Kira canon/archive verifier and Engine component integrity check pass. See [atlas validation](IRGS_3_3/catalog/campaigns/kira/atlas/VALIDATION.json). No fresh App or gameplay qualification is claimed.

## Inherited component and joined-development record

The entries below preserve earlier increment descriptions and evidence identities. Old branch names, App checks and original validation filenames describe those source runs. They do not direct current pushes or certify the present standalone Engine/App pair.

2026-10-22: Rise foundation 1 adds a reviewed fictional settlement founding path: limited permission, finite work and provision, bounded delegation and actual household migration in the shared Core. The eight design families remain held. See [current Rise status](engine/design/rise/README.md) and [qualification](RISE_FOUNDATION_VALIDATION.json).

## Earlier action and contextual-response increment

2026-10-21. Continues unified D1 with selected executable Core 3.3. Engine/Core changes belong to `3.3.3.E`, website changes to `3.3.3.A`, and the integrated source to `main`.

## Completed bounded milestone

DEV-01â€“DEV-04 implement one consequential Solo action: explicitly execute an existing received equipment order using actual current player control and a sourced operation-scoped mandate. The same Core transaction validates recipients and conserved stock, commits the transfer and marks the order executed. No historical inventory, permission or recipient is manufactured.

The host saves the accepted semantic request, resulting world, outcome, private dependency evidence and public receipt in one atomic save replacement. An identical retry retrieves the accepted result before current-revision and execution checks. Changed identity payloads, stale new requests and foreign character/campaign requests cannot repeat it. Invalid attempts and failed persistence leave the saved world unchanged. The interface displays the committed outcome, preserves a separate unsent draft, survives reload and permits the next action.

This qualifies the single-host, single-writer path. Multi-process coordination, power-loss durability, accepted pending failures, timed phases and restored-branch fencing remain future work. A failed equipment attempt is currently rejected without a new saved request; it is not a scheduled process.

## Suggested responses and custom answers

`receive_response_prompt` records an explicitly supplied, actor-scoped information prompt. Its choices remain suggestions, not feasibility findings or objective world changes. The Solo interface offers those choices and an editable own-response field. Selection copies text into a local draft; only explicit submission records the resulting declaration.

Choices may fail, carry risks or prove unsuitable. Hidden stock, private opponents or uncommunicated permissions do not select a guaranteed winning menu. Explicit combat prompts can provide situational choices; empty combat prompts use tentative generic approaches. Combat and other freeform responses remain unresolved declarations until their domain adjudication exists.

Prompts do not create an encounter, advance time or resolve combat. New historical games are not seeded with invented prompts or equipment merely to display a feature. Multiple equally recent active prompts do not silently acquire a priority from their IDs.

## Dependency work

The new equipment path observes actual current-control, authorization, order, recipient and stock reads. It checks instrumented against ordinary execution and retains actual differences as a write backstop. Competing claims cannot acquire a simultaneous winner through arrival order.

Collection qualification also corrects a caller-context dependency: unrelated constructors must not change observed footprints. R9 now distinguishes whole-list reads from standard list mutations. Reads remain coarse; arbitrary native plugins and every cross-engine branch are not certified by this increment. The separate implementation record and execution ledger identify named evidence and limits.

## Evidence and next work

See [ACTION1_VALIDATION.json](ACTION1_VALIDATION.json) for the actual executed checks, [engine/EQUIPMENT_ACTION_IMPLEMENTATION.md](engine/EQUIPMENT_ACTION_IMPLEMENTATION.md) for engine scope, and [engine/ACCEPTANCE_EXECUTION.md](engine/ACCEPTANCE_EXECUTION.md) for the C2 coverage mapping. The immutable 121-case source inventory has not been rewritten into a passing test report.

DEV-05 is now complete: [the operation register](engine/OPERATION_COVERAGE.md) lists all 168 declared backend/operation contracts, current observations, test identities and explicit gaps. See [COVERAGE1_VALIDATION.json](COVERAGE1_VALIDATION.json). Next: broader collection/failed-branch/conflict qualification under DEV-06â€“DEV-08. Durable phases, movement, dialogue, evolving historical control and sustained institutional autonomy remain on the continuation list. Suggested responses are a universal presentation feature alongside these capabilities, not a separate combat world.

The coverage capture also records 381 refused post-state matches across legacy caller/observer backend selections and 23 failed-probe rollback anomalies. These observations are excluded from qualification, with their named test contexts retained for DEV-06–DEV-08. There are no such refusals in the selected Core observations. These are repeated synthetic observation counts, not player incidents.

## Opening1 — playable local scene

The 1415 new-character setup now offers an optional reviewed fictional opening, **A dispatch before departure**. It supports repeated local observation, movement, blocked attempts, delivery and continued return movement. Actual location, knowledge, conserved dispatch and explicitly selected elapsed seconds persist together with durable successful/unsuccessful outcomes. Existing starts receive no automatic scene or migration. See [implementation and limits](engine/PLAYABLE_OPENING_IMPLEMENTATION.md) and OPENING1_VALIDATION.json. General freeform, combat, dialogue, interrupted phases and autonomous wider play remain unavailable.

## Campaign-start correction

The authored human-only opening now compares the registered species without case sensitivity, preserving the selected identity spelling. `Human` and `human` can both start; genuinely different species remain unavailable. A rejected creation request returns to character details with the campaign, entry and exact text retained, instead of restarting date selection. Lost-acknowledgement recovery retains its prior request identity. See STARTFIX_VALIDATION.json for executed scope.

## Adventure UI — Solo presentation

Campaign entry and character setup now use illustrative voyage artwork. The Solo story foregrounds the received scene, exact supported action choices and latest character-scoped outcome. Campaign controls, older records, historical references and the own-response editor remain available through expandable sections. Custom drafts still submit unresolved declarations; this presentation update adds no engine resolution. See [ADVENTURE_UI_VALIDATION.json](ADVENTURE_UI_VALIDATION.json) for the executed checks. This increment belongs to `3.3.3.A` and unified `main`; `3.3.3.E` retains its existing engine commit.

## Qualified failed-path dependencies

The dependency-rejections-1 increment retains verified rejected-probe reads with unresolved R9 frontier requests. Paired ordinary/traced rejection checks separate rolled-back attempts from effects, and named tests cover the selected Core, reference, economic and military/Roman backends plus settlement permission and worker reservations. Equipment and scene rejection diagnostics use the same check. See [implementation and limits](engine/REJECTED_DEPENDENCIES_IMPLEMENTATION.md) and DEPENDENCY_REJECTIONS_VALIDATION.json. DEV-06–DEV-08 remain broader open work.

## Consolidated Core and lean distribution

Existing genre receiving operations now execute as Core methods. Players see campaigns while technical setup remains in Creator mode. Superseded bundle archives and obsolete assembly tooling have been removed from the current source; original campaign data and referenced source evidence remain. Independent QA findings about unknown inventory units and canonical location records reproduce before correction and pass after correction. See `engine/CORE_CONSOLIDATION.md`, `QA_RESPONSE.md` and the current validation record.

## Independent environment confirmation

2026-10-22: The independent cloud QA report tests published candidate `59f2434` and passes all eight independent cases plus its listed source, freshness, runtime, Web, interface and tooling checks. IRGS-QA-001 and IRGS-QA-002 are not reproduced. Platform and external-fixture skips remain skips. See [QA_RESPONSE.md](QA_RESPONSE.md) for preserved reports and counts. This is confirmation of the existing implementation; broader DEV-06–DEV-08 and C2 certification remain open.

## Historical Grand Archive reference library

The historical-reference-1 increment attaches the separately supplied Grand Archive 1.1 as a read-only Creator library. Ten structured collections support search, paging, original source records, citations, uncertainty and provenance. The archive stays in its supplied source location; local registration is excluded from Git and packages. No historical start, continuing campaign, player knowledge or resource stock is initialized from these readings. See [integration](engine/HISTORICAL_REFERENCE_INTEGRATION.md) and HISTORICAL_REFERENCE_VALIDATION.json for the executed scope. The broader dependency and C2 milestones remain open.
